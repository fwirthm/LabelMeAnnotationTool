     * @todo handle concurrent data acces
     * @todo LabelMe creates for each mask a signle .png file and adds the name of the .png to xml <-> in the PASCAL VOC dataset exist for each image which is segmented (exactly) two .png files: one which shows all masks in the image with different colors for each object and one which has different colors for all classes --> maybe we need a script which merges all masks together (by object or by class)

     * This tool was originally implemented by B.C. Russel and others (see the project page: http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/).
     * For this version the code (from https://github.com/CSAILVision/LabelMeAnnotationTool) was modified to implement some new functions and creat PASCAL VOC conform XML-outputs within the work for the Flora Incognita Project (see: http://floraincognita.com/de/) by Florian Wirthmüller. The Code and some instructions relating to the installation and usage of the tool can be found at: https://github.com/fwirthm/LabelMeAnnotationTool
